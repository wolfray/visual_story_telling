## Overview

## Dependencies

* python 3.5
* pytorch (0.1.6)
* torchvision (0.1.9) 
* numpy 1.11.3

Since the pretrained model of choice is VGG (-16 or -19), pytorch has yet to release binaries for the pretrained version of said model. As such, we will be working with the master branch version (0.1.9) of *torchvision* instead of the publicly released binaries. To install them simply run  ```pip install https://github.com/pytorch/vision/archive/master.zip```
